* Develop system architecture for base so this can have a PCB made (display, memory, RTC etc)
* Test out RF modules
* Step up inductive charging to 12V to hopefully get better power output
* Investigate coupling coefficient as a function of coil separation
* Start working with different size/shape coils, which are more likely to be used by the probe
* Model probe shapes in Play-doh
