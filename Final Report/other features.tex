\end{figure}

A thermistor-based temperature sensor (figure \ref{fig: temperature sensor}) was included in the remote unit. This was to ensure that the measurements could be calibrated for any temperature-dependent effects and to measure the temperature within the autoclave. Because the remote unit will be packaged in a resin, it is unknown what the internal temperature will be when it is exposed to the heat of the autoclave, but the temperature sensor allows this to be measured. The Vishay NTCLG100E2103JB \cite{thermistor} thermistor was selected, which had a nominal resistance of \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} at \SI{25}{\celsius}. This was placed in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement with three fixed \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} resistors, which would produce a voltage imbalance, $\Delta v$, when the thermistor was not at \SI{25}{\celsius}. This voltage was input to a differential amplifier to yield an output signal which could be read by the PIC's ADC. The differential voltage $\Delta v$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
\Delta v = \frac{\delta R}{4 R}V_{CC}
\end{equation}
where $\delta R$ is the change in resistance of the thermistor and $R=\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}$. The output voltage $v_o$ is then given by applying the differential amplifier gain:
\begin{equation}
v_o = \frac{R_1}{R / 2} \Delta v =R_1 \frac{\delta R}{2 R^2}V_{CC}
\end{equation}
where $R_1$ is the value of the feedback resistors R11 and R12, and $V_{CC} =\SI{5}{\volt}$ is the supply voltage. Note that a \SI{2.5}{\volt} rail is used as a pseudo-ground to allow the output to swing positive and negative.\\

The sensor was designed to have a range of \SIrange{5}{150}{\celsius}, to cover the minimum operating temperature of just below room temperature of \SI{20}{\celsius} and up to the maximum temperature of the autoclave, \SI{134}{\celsius} \cite{nhs_autoclave}. Using \SI{6.8}{\kilo\ohm} feedback resistors gave an output voltage of \SI{5}{\volt} at \SI{5}{\celsius} and \SI{0.831}{\volt} at \SI{150}{\celsius}. At the high range, the thermistor only gives a small $\delta R$ per degree of temperature change, so the sensor will not have a high resolution at these temperatures. For example, the output voltage at \SI{145}{\celsius} is \SI{0.835}{\volt}. The PIC's ADC has a minimum voltage resolution of \SI{4.88}{\milli\volt}, which means that the temperature resolution will be just larger than \SI{5}{\celsius} at high temperatures. As the high range is only used to understand the thermal properties of the autoclave and not to calibrate the measurements, this resolution will be acceptable. In comparison, at room temperature the resolution is much greater (for example a \SI{0.423}{\volt} change gave a temperature resolution of \SI{0.058}{\celsius} as the temperature decreased from \SIrange{25}{20}{\celsius}, ).





\subsection{LCD}
\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{LCD interface circuitry.}
	\label{fig: lcd schematic}
\end{figure}

PICBASIC had a built-in command \verb|lcdout| which could be used to control an LCD with a Hitachi 44780 controller \cite{picbasic_pro}. To this end, an LCD module with an equivalent controller was selected. A 4x20 character matrix was required to enable the screen to display all the necessary information. The Displaytech 204-A-CC-BC-3LP \cite{lcd} was selected. This used the Samsung KS0076B driver, which had an equivalent instruction set to the Hitachi 44780, meaning it could be controlled using the \verb|lcdout| command. Figure \ref{fig: lcd schematic} shows the LCD interface circuitry. The R/$\overline{\text{W}}$ pin was tied to ground, as the LCD only needed to be written to. $V_o$ controlled the contrast of the display, and the datasheet recommended biasing this at \SI{0.2}{\volt} \cite{lcd}. The remaining pins were data signals which were connected to PIC pins. The LCD could operate using either a 4- or 8-bit parallel interface \cite{picbasic_pro}. In this application, the 4-bit interface was chosen to minimise the number of PIC pins used by the LCD. The \verb|lcdout| command required that these 4 data signals were connected to either the upper or lower nybble of a single I/O port. Only \verb|PORTA<0:3>| was suitable, as all the remaining ports had pins which were required for other functions or unimplemented bits in the \verb|PORT|.\\

The \verb|lcdout| command allowed simple control of the LCD. First, several \verb|define|s were set to configure the compiler. Then, commands could be written to the LCD by sending the byte \verb|$FE| before the corresponding command in the PICBASIC manual \cite{picbasic_pro} or LCD datasheet \cite{lcd}. Characters could be written by looking up the character code in the LCD's character map (specified in the datasheet \cite{lcd}) or by providing PICBASIC with the required string. A delay was required between each write operation to ensure the LCD was ready to receive another instruction, otherwise an error would occur. A simple program is included below, and the output is shown in figure \ref{fig: lcd}.

\subsection{Memory}

	\centering

	\caption{EEPROM interface circuitry.}
	\label{fig: memory schematic}
\end{figure}

The base unit required some non-volatile memory to store measurements before they were uploaded to a computer. The EEPROM was designed to store a minimum of 1000 readings. Each reading had several components: the reading ID, month, day, hour, minute, measurement value, and temperature reading. This led to a total reading size of 9 bytes. This meant that the memory required to store 1000 readings was $\SI{9}{\kilo\byte}=\SI{72}{\kilo\bit}$. The Microchip 24FC256-I/ST \cite{memory} was a suitable EEPROM chip, and was \SI{256}{\kilo\bit}. This allowed 3555 readings to be stored. The circuit in figure \ref{fig: memory schematic} was designed according to the datasheet recommendations \cite{memory}. The device communicated over an I\textsuperscript{2}C interface, so it was connected to the PIC's SDA and SCL lines. These lines had \SI{2.2}{\kilo\ohm} pull-up resistors, as per I\textsuperscript{2}C specifications. The address pin A2 was pulled low by the \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} pull-down resistor (R10) to set the address to \verb|0b1010000|.\\

The EEPROM chip was accessed using the PICBASIC \verb|i2cread| and \verb|i2cwrite| commands. The EEPROM allowed for sequential reads, so multiple bytes of data could be read using one I\textsuperscript{2}C instruction, with the data saved to an array. To ensure the correct EEPROM address was used, a counter was stored in the PIC's internal EEPROM to record how many readings were stored in the external EEPROM. This was required because when the base unit powers on, it needs to know how many readings are already in the EEPROM, otherwise they will be overwritten.





\subsection{Real-Time Clock}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{rtc.PNG}
	\caption{RTC interface circuitry.}
	\label{fig: rtc schematic}
\end{figure}

An RTC was required in the base unit to timestamp the measurements, so it was clear which operation the data referred to. The Microchip MCP7940N-I/SN \cite{rtc} was selected, and the circuit (figure \ref{fig: rtc schematic}) was laid out according to the datasheet recommendations \cite{rtc}. A \SI{3}{\volt} CR2032 battery was used as a backup power supply for the module to ensure the clock would continue timing even if the base power was removed. The module communicates over an I\textsuperscript{2}C interface, so it was connected to the PIC's SDA and SCL lines. The MFP output was not used.





\subsection{Buttons}
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{switches.jpg}
	\caption{Breakout board for push buttons.}
	\label{fig: buttons}
\end{figure}

The base unit required some buttons to interact with the menu. Four buttons were required, termed ``MENU'', ``OK'', ``UP'', and ``DOWN''. The 2-1825910-7 tactile switch \cite{buttons} available from Farnell was suitable and was used with \SI{15}{\kilo\ohm} pull-up resistors. Due to a lack of available pins on the PIC, the ``OK'' and ``DOWN'' buttons were connected to the ``ICSPDAT'' and ``ICSPCLK'' lines, respectively. These are used for in-circuit serial programming, and the inclusion of the switch circuits does not cause an issue, because the pull-up resistor allows the programmer to take control of the line whenever it requires. The ``MENU'' button was initially connected to an external interrupt pin ``INT2'', but after testing was changed to the ``$\overline{\text{MCLR}}$'' pin. When in normal operation, the base unit spends most of its time listening for data coming from the remote unit. When the ``MENU'' button is pressed, however, the base unit should immediately transition to the menu screen. PICBASIC does not have a convenient method to interrupt the \verb|serin2| command, so the ``MENU'' button was changed to the ``$\overline{\text{MCLR}}$'' pin to hard reset the unit when the button was pressed. The buttons could be read by a simple digital read to the corresponding PIC pin. A breakout board (figure \ref{fig: buttons}) was designed for the buttons to be soldered to, which in turn could be mounted to the base unit casing by M2 bolts.
