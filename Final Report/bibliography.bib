abstract = {The incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has risen along with the ongoing obesity epidemic. Green tea extract (GTE) inhibits intestinal lipid absorption and may regulate hepatic lipid accumulation. The objective of this study was to determine whether GTE protects against hepatic lipid accumulation during the development of NAFLD in an obese mouse model. Five-wk-old ob/ob (obese) mice and their lean littermates (8 mice-genotype -1-dietary treatment-1) were fed GTE at 0, 1, or 2{\%} (wt:wt) for 6 wk. The body weights of obese mice and lean littermates fed diets containing GTE were 23-25{\%} and 11-20{\%} lower (P{\textless}0.05) than their respective controls fed no GTE. Histologic evaluation showed a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis in GTE-fed obese mice only and histologic scores were correlated with hepatic lipid concentration (r = 0.84; P {\textless} 0.05), which was reduced dose dependently by GTE. GTE protected against hepatic injury as suggested by 30-41{\%} and 22-33{\%} lower serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, respectively. Hepatic $\alpha$-tocopherol was 36{\%} higher in obese mice than lean mice. GTE tended (P = 0.06) to lower hepatic $\alpha$-tocopherol, which was not fully explained by the GTE-mediated reduction in hepatic lipid. Hepatic ascorbic acid was lower in obese mice than in lean mice (P {\textless} 0.05) and was unaltered by GTE. Obese mice had lower serum adiponectin than lean mice and this was not affected by GTE. The results suggest that GTE protects against NAFLD by limiting hepatic lipid accumulation and injury without affecting hepatic antioxidant status and adiponectin-mediated lipid metabolism. Further study is underway to define the events by which GTE protects against obesity-triggered NAFLD. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society for Nutrition.},

abstract = {Initial graft function is a major factor influencing the clinical outcome after liver transplantation (LTX), but a reliable method for assessing and predicting graft dysfunction directly after LTX is not available. Ninety-nine patients undergoing deceaseddonor LTX were studied in a prospective pilot study to evaluate the LiMAx test, the indocyanine green test, and conventional biochemical parameters with respect to their sensitivity and prognostic power for the diagnosis of initial graft dysfunction. Patients suffering from initial graft dysfunction (defined as technical complications or primary nonfunction (n = 8)) had significantly decreased LiMAx readouts (43 ± 18 versus 184 ± 98 lg/kg/hour, P {\textless} 0.001) immediately after LTX. Univariate analysis also showed significant differences for serum bilirubin, ammonia, glutamate dehydrogenase, and the international normalized ratio (P {\textless} 0.05), but multivariate analysis revealed LiMAx as the single independent predictor of initial dysfunction (P = 0.008) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.960 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.921-0.998, P {\textless} 0.001). In addition, the diagnosis of primary nonfunction (n = 3) was evaluated with LiMAx and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity on the first postoperative day. The calculated AUROC values were 0.992 (0.975-1.0, P = 0.004) for LiMAx and 0.967 (0.929-1.0, P = 0.006) for AST. By a combination of test results obtained directly after LTX and on the first day, LiMAx indicated primary nonfunction with a sensitivity of 1.0 (0.31-1.0) and a positive predictive value of 1.0 (0.31-1.0), whereas AST classification showed a sensitivity of 0.67 (0.13-0.98) and a positive predictive value of 0.29 (0.05-0.70). In conclusion, the assessment of initial graft function using the LiMAx test might be effective for identifying critical complications that could threaten graft survival within 24 hours after LTX. {\textcopyright} 2010 AASLD.},

abstract = {In parallel with the pandemic of obesity and diabetes, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has progressively increased. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subtype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has also augmented considerably being currently cirrhosis due to NASH the second indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Innovative treatments for NASH have shown promising results in phase 2 studies and are being presently evaluated in phase 3 trials. On the other hand, the high mortality on the liver transplant waitlist and the organ shortage has obligated the transplant centers to consider suboptimal grafts, such as steatotic livers for transplantation. Fatty livers are vulnerable to preservation injury resulting in a higher rate of primary nonfunction, early allograft dysfunction and posttransplant vascular and biliary complications. Macrosteatosis of more than 30{\%} in fact is an independent risk factor for graft loss. Therefore, it needs to be considered into the risk assessment scores. Growing evidence supports that moderate and severe macrosteatotic grafts can be successfully used for liver transplantation with careful recipient selection. Protective strategies, such as machine-based perfusion have been developed in experimental setting to minimize preservation-related injury and are now on the verge to move into the clinical implementation. This review focuses on the current and potential future treatment of NASH and the clinical practice in fatty liver transplantation, highlights its limitations and optimal allocation, and summarizes the advances of experimental protective strategies, and their potential for clinical application to increase the acceptance and improve the outcomes after liver transplantation with high-grade steatotic livers.},

In the sequence, it is shown that a 4-coils WPT system (which can be divided in source, two communication and load circuits) without power losses at the two communication circuits (ideal 4-coils WPT system) presents, from maximum power transfer and efficiency point of view, a performance similar to those of a 2-coils WPT system. The exception is the influence of coupling coefficient (k): in 2-coils system $\eta$ increases as k approaches one, while in ideal 4-coils WPT system $\eta$ increases as k between the two communication coils approaches zero. In addition, realistic 4-coils WPT systems (with power losses at the two communication circuits) are also analyzed showing, for instance, that $\eta$ presents a maximum as a function of k of the communication coils. In order to validate the presented theory, 4 coils were built, and a setup to perform 2-coils and 4-coils WPT systems has been carried out. Practical results show good agreement with the developed theory.},

abstract = {This paper presents a duty cycle-based, dual-mode simultaneous wireless information and power transceiver (SWIPT) for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in which a sensor node monitors the received power and adaptively controls the single-tone or multitone communication mode. An adaptive power-splitting (PS) ratio control scheme distributes the received radio frequency (RF) energy between the energy harvesting (EH) path and the information decoding (ID) path. The proposed SWIPT enables the self-powering of an ID transceiver above 20 dBm input power, leading to a battery-free network. The optimized PS ratio of 0.44 enables it to provide sufficient harvested energy for self-powering and energy-neutral operation of the ID transceiver. The ID transceiver can demodulate the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) and the binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signals. Moreover, for low-input power level, a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) scheme based on multitone is also proposed for demodulation of the information-carrying RF signals. Due to the limited power, information is transmitted in uplink by backscatter modulation instead of RF signaling. To validate our proposed SWIPT architecture, a SWIPT printed circuit board (PCB) was designed with a multitone SWIPT board at 900 MHz. The demodulation of multitone by PAPR was verified separately on the PCB. Results showed the measured sensitivity of the SWIPT to be??7 dBm, and the measured peak power efficiency of the RF energy harvester was 69{\%} at 20 dBm input power level. The power consumption of the injection-locked oscillator (ILO)-based phase detection path was 13.6 mW, and it could be supplied from the EH path when the input power level was high. The ID path could demodulate 4-ASK- and BPSK-modulated signals at the same time, thus receiving 3 bits from the demodulation process. Maximum data rate of 4 Mbps was achieved in the measurement.},

abstract = {Inductive communication is an emerging physical layer technology for secure communications which has promise to provide significant incentives in body area networks and other short range communication systems. This paper presents the principles and performance of inductive communication systems from the points of view of the efficiencies of the transmitter and receiver topologies. The rapid reduction of power level with distance to power six means that inductive systems should be designed for efficient flux coupling to the receiver. This therefore needs to be quantified. This paper proposes a performance measure using both the trans-impedance and a new factor called the induction factor which describes the magnitude of induced power caused by a transmitter at the receiver. The effects of system parameters on performance are modeled, simulated and discussed. Four system topologies are identified and their performances in terms of the influences of the system components are investigated. Different topologies result to different induced voltages in the receiver. We demonstrate that at frequencies below 1.4 MHz, the performance of the series-series and series-parallel topologies are almost identical. We also show by the induction factor concept that the series-parallel (transmitter-receiver) topology provides more induced voltage to the receiver at high frequencies above 1.4 MHz. This is demonstrated for frequencies up to 4.5 MHz. Many applications use frequencies above 1 MHz, making these results highly essential for inductive system design and development. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Transplantation of severely steatotic donor livers is associated with early allograft dysfunction and poorer graft survival. Histology remains the gold standard diagnostic of donor steatosis despite the lack of consensus definition and its subjective nature. In this prospective observational study of liver transplant patients, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a handheld optical backscatter probe to assess the degree of hepatic steatosis and correlate the backscatter readings with clinical outcomes. The probe is placed on the surface of the liver and emits red and near infrared light from the tip of the device and measures the amount of backscatter of light from liver tissue via two photodiodes. Measurement of optical backscatter (Man-tel-Cox P {\textless} 0.0001) and histopathological scoring of macrovesicular steatosis (Mantel-Cox P = 0.046) were predictive of 5-year graft survival. Recipients with early allograft dysfunction defined according to both Olth-off (P = 0.0067) and MEAF score (P = 0.0097) had significantly higher backscatter levels from the donor organ. Backscatter was predictive of graft loss (AUC 0.75, P = 0.0045). This study demonstrates the feasibility of real-time measurement of optical backscatter in donor livers. Early results indicate readings correlate with steatosis and may give insight to graft outcomes such as early allograft dysfunction and graft loss.},

abstract = {New technique of diffuse reflectance spectroscopic analysis of milk fat and total protein content in the visible (Vis) and adjacent near infrared (NIR) region (400–995 nm) has been developed and tested. Sample analysis was performed through a probe having eight 200-µm fiber channels forming a linear array. One of the end fibers was used for the illumination and other seven – for the spectroscopic detection of diffusely reflected light. One of the detection channels was used as a reference to normalize the spectra and to convert them into absorbance-equivalent units. The method has been tested experimentally using a designed sample set prepared from industrial raw milk standards with widely varying fat and protein content. To increase the modelling robustness all milk samples were measured in three different homogenization degrees. Comprehensive data analysis has shown the advantage of combining both spectral and spatial resolution in the same measurement and revealed the most relevant channels and wavelength regions. The modelling accuracy was further improved using joint variable selection and preprocessing optimization method based on the genetic algorithm. The root mean-square errors of different validation methods were below 0.10{\%} for fat and below 0.08{\%} for total protein content. Based on the present experimental data, it was computationally shown that the full-spectrum analysis in this method can be replaced by a sensor measurement at several specific wavelengths, for instance, using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for illumination. Two optimal sensor configurations have been suggested: with nine LEDs for the analysis of fat and seven – for protein content. Both simulated sensors exhibit nearly the same component determination accuracy as corresponding full-spectrum analysis.},

abstract = {Macro-steatosis in deceased donor livers is increasingly prevalent and is associated with poor or non-function of the liver upon reperfusion. Current assessment of the extent of steatosis depends upon the macroscopic assessment of the liver by the surgeon and histological examination, if available. In this paper we demonstrate electrical and optical spectroscopy techniques which quantitatively characterize fatty infiltration in liver tissue. Optical spectroscopy showed a correlation coefficient of 0.85 in humans when referenced to clinical hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) sections in 20 human samples. With further development, an optical probe may provide a comprehensive measure of steatosis across the liver at the time of procurement.},

abstract = {Both in medical research and clinical settings, regional hemoglobin concentrations ([Hb]) in the microcirculation of biological tissues are highly sought. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy has been proven to be a favorable method by which to detect regional [Hb]. This paper introduces a new algorithm to retrieve [Hb] information from diffuse reflectance spectra. The proposed algorithm utilizes the natural logarithmic operation and the differential wavelet transform to effectively quench the scattering effects, and then employs the concept of isosbestic wavelength in the transformed spectra to reduce the effects of hemoglobin oxygenation. As a result, the intensity at the defined isosbestic wavelength of the transformed spectra is a good indicator of [Hb] estimation. The algorithm was derived and validated using theoretical spectra produced by Monte Carlo simulation of photon migration. Its accuracy was further evaluated using liquid tissue phantoms, and its clinical utility with an in vivo clinical study of brain tumors. The results demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm for real-time [Hb] estimations from diffuse reflectance spectra, acquired by means of a fiber-optic spectroscopy system.},

@article{Lin2010,
abstract = {The concept of using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to distinguish intraoperatively between pediatric brain tumors and normal brain parenchyma at the edge of resection cavities is evaluated using an in vivo human study. Diffuse reflectance spectra are acquired from normal and tumorous brain areas of 12 pediatric patients during their tumor resection procedures, using a spectroscopic system with a handheld optical probe. A total of 400 spectra are acquired at the rate of 33 Hz from a single investigated site, from which the mean spectrum and the standard deviation are calculated. The mean diffuse reflectance spectra collected are divided into the normal and the tumorous categories in accordance with their corresponding results of histological analysis. Statistical methods are used to identify those spectral features that effectively separated the two tissue categories, and to quantify the spectral variations induced by the motion of the handheld probe during a single spectral acquisition procedure. The results show that diffuse reflectance spectral intensities between 600 and 800 nm are effective in terms of differentiating normal cortex from brain tumors. Furthermore, probe movements induce large variations in spectral intensities (i.e., larger standard deviation) between 400 and 600 nm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},
