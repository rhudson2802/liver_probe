\section{Microcontroller}
A Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC) was chosen as the microcontroller for both the base and remote unit. PICs are versatile, with highly configurable pin assignments, which were suitable for sub-systems used in the product. Furthermore, they are easy to program in PICBASIC using the MicroCode Studio \cite{microcode_studio} and MPLAB IDE software packages. The free version of MicroCode Studio limits the range of devices which can be programmed, so the PIC16F688 (14-pin) \cite{pic16f688} was chosen for the remote unit and the PIC18F2550 (28-pin) \cite{pic18f2550} for the base unit. These had the right number of I/O pins for their respective unit, as well as some special features which will be discussed in later sections.\\

The PICkit 3 \cite{pickit3} was used to program the PICs. Figure \ref{fig: pickit3} shows the relevant connections required for programming. The PIC18F2550 had a USB interface, which took up the majority of \verb|PORTC|. When the PIC was tested on the breadboard, these USB pins could not operate as standard I/O pins as they pulled the pin high or low. The data sheet specified that USB functionality could be turned off by writing to the \verb|UCON| and \verb|UCFG| registers, but this did not work. This meant that the pins designated for USB were not used in this project.\\
