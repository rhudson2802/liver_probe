\section{System Architecture}

The system was subdivided into two devices: the ``base'' unit and the ``remote'' unit. The remote unit would perform the measurement on the liver and transmit the data to the base unit. Only the remote unit will need to be hermetically sealed and able to withstand the sterilisation process, as the base unit does not come in contact with biological tissues. Furthermore, all the expensive electronics such as the screen can be contained within the base, making the remote unit cheaper and hence more disposable. Also, only the remote unit will need to be mechanically robust to the clinical environment, so the base unit can be packaged less rigidly.

The remote unit will be packaged by casting the electronics in a resin, which will provide the hermetic seal and mechanical robustness. Because of this, it cannot be opened or have any sockets to connect cables. Therefore, it must communicate wirelessly with the base unit, and be battery powered with wireless charging. The wireless communications are required to operate over a range of several metres, as it is assumed that the base unit could be placed at the opposite side of the room to where the surgery is happening. Figure \ref{fig: architecture} shows the system block diagram with all the key sub-systems labelled.
